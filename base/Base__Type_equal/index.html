One can think of such a value as a proof of type equality. The <code>Type_equal</code> module has operations for constructing and manipulating such proofs. For example, the functions <code>refl</code>, <code>sym</code>, and <code>trans</code> express the usual properties of reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity of equality.</p><p>If one has a value <code>t : (a, b) Type_equal.t</code> that proves types <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are equal, there are two ways to use <code>t</code> to safely convert a value of type <code>a</code> to a value of type <code>b</code>: <code>Type_equal.conv</code> or pattern matching on <code>Type_equal.T</code>:</p><pre><code>let f (type a) (type b) (t : (a, b) Type_equal.t) (a : a) : b =
  Type_equal.conv t a

let f (type a) (type b) (t : (a, b) Type_equal.t) (a : a) : b =
  let Type_equal.T = t in a</code></pre><p>At runtime, conversion by either means is just the identity -- nothing is changing about the value. Consistent with this, a value of type <code>Type_equal.t</code> is always just a constructor <code>Type_equal.T</code>; the value has no interesting semantic content. <code>Type_equal</code> gets its power from the ability to, in a type-safe way, prove to the type checker that two types are equal. The <code>Type_equal.t</code> value that is passed is necessary for the type-checker's rules to be correct, but the compiler could, in principle, not pass around values of type <code>Type_equal.t</code> at runtime.</p></header><div class="content"></div></body></html>
